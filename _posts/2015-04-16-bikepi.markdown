The first version, the DIY OpenSource version, will properly be available in Sping 2015. The commercial version will follow.

But keep in mind that the commercial product will be based on a custom board and programmed in C-Language. And don't get too attached how it looks like ether.  

A new and improved version of the demo version/ prototype is work in progress. Stay tuned.
